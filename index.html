    <h1>James Montero-Blaskett</h1>
    <p id="test">This is one layout option, (not loading this page into the iFrame
        on the same page though, that's terrible) use this as the master page
        and then load the links directly into the iFrame.  Doing it this way
        means you could decorate the crap out of the main page, then use basic
        content for any other pages.  It WOULD mean that scrolling would get
        weird on screens that are too small though.
    </p>
        <iframe name="mainFrame" src="#test">This won't show up, there are complicated
            ways to display default content, but it's definitely best to just have
            a valid source url or file to put into the iFrame.
