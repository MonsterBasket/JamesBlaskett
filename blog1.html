        <h1>The Things I Say</h1>
        <h3>~ Academy Xi - the First Mile ~</h3>
        <p>
            Well. That could have gone better.
            <br><br>I mean, I made it, but only by the skin of my teeth. For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, I've recently started a Software Engineering "transformation" course through Academy Xi. The "First Mile" is what they call the first two weeks, and this blog is my reflection of those first two weeks.
            <br><br><span style="text-decoration:line-through">If you're a regular reader you'll know that A: this is only my second ever blog so how can you be a regular reader, and B: I was never exactly a model student. Even when I completed my degree in digital animation, I graduated because the technical side of it came so easily to me, not because I was particularly studious. The graduation rate is also very high so I didn't feel exceptionally accomplished for having graduated. One of the supposed guidelines for writing for the web is to be concise, ie. don't use a whole paragraph that rambles on when all you really need to say is</span> "I've never been particularly studious".
            <br><br>There. Fixed.</p>
            <figure><img style="width: 95%" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*zEZZyThhkrDqrGzR" alt="Somebody playing video games"><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cactuspix?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Ke Vin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> - Leave me alone, I'm "studying".</p></figure>
            <p>I knew coming into this course that it was going to be intense, and I knew I'd never really studied before and that I didn't know what to expect. I was prepared as I could be though, my wife and I had both had a chance to get mentally prepared for it; her mum and sister are visiting from the US which means she has some help with our son and chores etc.; I read through a LOT of the pre-reading materials, including getting quite a long way through the tutorials on javascripttutorial. And I mean, hey, it's only phase 0 of 5 (0 of 6? it goes up to 5, so there are 6, but does phase 0 count as a phase if it doesn't even get a real number? Is that just a programming joke because arrays start at 0?), how hard can it be?
            <br><br>The first week went well. I'd study through the day, and then when we'd sit down to watch TV of an evening I'd study some more, because I was enjoying it. My plan was to get through the modules (the reading and mini-assignments - or labs - that teach us all we need to know to complete the final project) in the first week (we had plans on the weekend in the middle) and that would allow me to start fresh on the final project on Monday. So far so good, that part went mostly to plan and I started my project on Tuesday instead… After staying up quite late the night before to finish those last modules.</p>
            <figure><img style="width: 95%" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*jh-1w8yvEBwx9wuN" alt="man on couch at night working on laptop"><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Kenny Eliason</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> - basically me, but at as if I'd ever put a giant Facebook sticker on my laptop.</p></figure>
            <p>Okay, so finished everything by Monday night, not terrible, but why did the modules take me longer than I thought? The answer to this is an important lesson I've learned. We were even told that the modules were optional, but I completed them all, and I completed them all really quite thoroughly, even enhancing them beyond what they needed to be. I also spent a lot of time dabbling with half-learnt concepts that were bubbling around in my head; but if I'd just continued with the modules, I would have known how to do it without wasting my time trying to figure it out.
            <br><br>So in terms of the modules, I'll definitely approach them differently in the next Phase. Any concepts that I want to play with or don't fully understand, I'll just take a note to come back to it later IF I have time, and I'm going to really focus on the modules without getting side-tracked. And that's the other problem. I mean, it's not like I'm distracted playing video games (as much as that may have been my downfall in the past), I'm actually studying and learning, but I'm just learning tangential information. As an example, while I was going through the javascript tutorial material, I came across an article about why mod and remainder are not the same. Now this may or may not be news to you, but it's really obscure, and they actually are the same as long as you don't use them on negative numbers. Maybe I'll learn otherwise during this course, but I suspect most developers don't ever even have to worry about this because it's so obscure. But hey, I know it, that was a valuable use of my time right?
            <p style ="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">I'm not really cut out for it, however, because little rabbit holes exist everywhere and I'm kind of like a magpie-rabbit: <em>I chase shiny things down deep holes.</em> I'm also super amazing with metaphors.</p><p>Sums me up perfectly. <a href="https://bigmachine.io/2018/08/21/mod-and-remainder-are-not-the-same-2/">bigmachine.io/mod and remainder are not the same.</a></quote>
            
            <br><br>That's certainly part of the reason why my project took longer than I expected it to, especially in the first few days. But aside from that I continually refused to follow my own advice. I stumbled upon this <a href ="https://danmall.com/articles/its-easier-to-revise-than-create/">absolute gem of advice</a>, and then spent days tweaking, refining and trying to fix the math behind one particular mechanic in my project, rather than just putting it aside and roughing out the rest. So again, going forward I'm going to make a serious effort to just not get bogged down in the detail. I did scrap a couple of attempts at different features because they were taking too long, but I just need to be better at walking away. 
            <br><br>Certainly there was a bit of pride getting in the way. There's an expression in the film industry that sometimes editors need to cut their favourite scenes from a movie because they just don't fit well. It's a very hard thing to do emotionally, there were times where I felt like I really should have cut what started out as my favourite feature in my project. In hind-sight, I definitely should have cut it. There were also a few features that were fun to work on (at first, but dragged on) but actually really don't look that great. Unfortunately I don't have the hardened editing experience to make those hard decisions, especially while I'm still trying to figure out the math!
            <br><br>So yeah. It's been a tough week, I've been going to bed later and later each night (he says, at 1am) trying to work through the issues I've faced in the project, which means I've been more and more tired. That's been really hard and unfair on my wife too, and it's just not sustainable.
            <br><br>But, while I'm not really happy with how my final project turned out, I do have to acknowledge just how much I've learnt in two short (actually very long - close to 90 hours this week!) weeks. I'm looking forward to a well earned day off tomorrow, and then straight into Phase 1!
