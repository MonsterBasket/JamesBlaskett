/*#region ---------------- Start Stickies -----------------*/

/* -------------------- Read Me 1: usage --------------------
This implementation results in a non-full screen page by page window (I'm sure there's better terminology, but that's what I'm going with).

1. Moving the stickies:  There are 4 variables in :root that are used to move and size the content frame.  If you wish position it from the left
        instead of the right, search for #leftNotRight for everything you'll need to edit.
2. Covering the stickies:  .coverTop and .coverBottom cover a small amount of overflow.  You can add customised images into them if you don't want
        a solid colour background.  Just make sure to line up any content above and below.
3. Sticky content: There are currently three stickies.  You'll need to add content into the relevant sections in the HTML file.  You've also got 
        some space available below for styling.
4. Side content: To make it static, just add it as a child to the slider and position it left of right.  To make it scroll, add it as a child to the
        slider ABOVE, and set it's bottom position down about 2x --stickyHeight.
5. Background: There's a div (<article>) in place and two preset (but as yet untested) image holders, just fill in the URL and uncomment whichever
        you want.  (Note that for scrolling, the height will be several 000 px.
6. More stickies: It's possible, but you'll have to create the divs (remember, they go bottom to top), add a variable for each extra set, edit the
        current --slider3 and --lastSlider calculations, and add your new tags into several places in the uneditable section.

  */
/* -------------------- Read Me 2: scalability (technical, not useful) -------
I finally have a full scalable solution!  As long as you use vw/vh or px and not %, then everything works as it should... The issue is due to
fixed backgrounds, however you can't use the work around unless you commit to ONLY using % values.   -   (fixed background work-around https://codepen.io/monsterbasket/pen/abYdaLK?editors=1100)

The --coverBottom is tricky.  It needs to allow for different screen sizes and fill the whole gap from the bottom of the content to the bottom
of the screen.  It ALSO needs to be higher than --stickyHeight, or else things will show when you scroll past the stickies.  As the highest
standard screens are 1080 or 1440, you only need --stickyHeight + --stickyTop to be above 600 or so before content starts to show with any
automatic calculations.  I've gone with a default value of 1000px.  You're going to need higher content than that to allow the stickies to 
fully scroll off the screen anyway, then you're better off just covering with other content.

What this means is to not put any content or backgrounds directly into body, but fill the screen with other content, even if they're just for
background images.  As mentioned, make sure any content above or below is at z-index 4 or higher to ensure it covers the content as it scrolls.
However keep in mind that these are STICKIES!  So any content below will either need to start at or below --lastSlider or else they'll visibly 
scroll over --coverBottom.  (if that's what you want, start content 8 pixels higher (border blur) than --slider3 instead.
